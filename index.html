<h1>
Norm and Exceptions
</h1>
<p>
In all large charts the likelyhood of running into exceptions is very high.  There will always be those that stray from the norm and this can be both good and bad as it all depends on what the data is about.  Say we are covering test scores like in the chapter, if a school had higher than average test scores than it might be a good idea to look at what that school does and have the other schools replicate it, but if a school is below average than it might be a good idea to see to it that the schools negative traits are eliminated from it and other schools facing the same problem.  On norms it should be noted that being normal statisticaly isnt bad but it shouldn't be looked at as the do all be all state for everything.  It should also be made aware to everyone that in charts a specific piece of data might be an outlier to what ever created it in its own chart of data through time and sometimes its better to take a closer look at things rather than judging something soley based off of data charts.
